<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Course Cluster a distributed and scalable course registration system developed for CS1380 at Brown University. CourseCluster is designed to manage large volumes of student and course data, ensuring scalability and data consistency across nodes. We deployed our system to Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to enhance performance and stability across multiple nodes, and connected the system to a web interface.  The majority of the system was developed through NodeJS and Javascript.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The deployed live site will most likely be down due to cost of running the many EC2 instances necessary for distribution.

Live site is available [here](http://52.53.161.207).
